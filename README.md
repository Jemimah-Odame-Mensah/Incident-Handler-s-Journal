# Security Incident Documentation
This repository showcases my work on documenting a Security Incident Response scenario as part of my cybersecurity training. The scenario was designed to simulate a real-world incident, allowing me to practice incident response principles by using an Incident Handler’s Journal, a crucial tool in the cybersecurity incident response process.

## Project Overview
In this scenario, I handled a simulated security incident involving a ransomware attack on a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The attack severely disrupted the clinic’s operations by encrypting critical files, including patient records, rendering the company’s systems unusable. The incident stemmed from a phishing attack that allowed unethical hackers to deploy ransomware after employees downloaded a malicious attachment.

As part of this activity, I documented the incident following a structured process using the Incident Handler’s Journal. The journal serves as a record of key details, enabling efficient analysis and response to security incidents.

## Key Steps

### Incident Documentation:

- **Scenario Review**: I analyzed the details of the simulated ransomware attack, identifying that it was caused by a phishing email containing malware.
- **Journal Entry**: I documented the simulated incident using the structured journal format, capturing essential information such as:
    - **Who** caused the incident.
    - **What** happened.
    - **When** the incident occurred.
    - **Where** the incident took place.
    - **Why** the incident occurred.

I completed an entry in the Incident Handler’s Journal, documenting the five W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why) and additional thoughts about the security incident. This entry provides a clear and organized overview of the incident, which can be referenced in future situations.
